        <p>
          The art of tasting whiskey is much simpler than you think. You can read so many reviews and tasting notes that refer to a whiskey as having the flavour of 'sherbert, dark chocolate or burnt rubber', that it can leave you wondering "am I tasting the same whiskey?". But how do you learn to pick up such extreme, different and expressive characteristics?
          The answer is to build up experiences of tasting different things that are unrelated to whiskey and taking a 'taste snapshot' of the characteristics of that flavour. The more that you do this, the better and more precise your whiskey tasting will become. Another key is that whiskey is unlike most other spirits in that the true character comes through after some time, so it is important not to drink it too quickly. It is important to remember that taste is a personal thing and that there are no right or wrong answers.
          Enjoy the journey!

        <h2>The Importance of <strike>Class</strike> <strong>Glass</strong></h2>
        <p>
          The type of glass that you use will help your cause massively. It is best to use one that has a narrow opening as this will channel and concentrate the aromas of the whiskey towards your nostrils. This type of glass is called a <strong>snifter</strong>, but a similar shaped wine or brandy glass would work just as well. Some come with an additional glass plate that is placed over the top of the glass and this plate helps to trap the aromas. Glasses such as tumblers or those with a wide rim should be avoided for tasting purposes, as the aromas dissipate too quickly.
